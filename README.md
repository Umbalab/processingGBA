# Processing.gba
A C language graphics library inspired by processing to create Game Boy Advance ROMs

The main idea here was to develop a library with graphics functions for GBA Mode 5. To achieve this, I adapted the writing style of some of the processing functions and some of their examples.

#Due credits and acknowledgements

I thank the programmers who made their code available for consultation on personal and organizational websites and GitHub. I also thank the members of the Creative Programming group on Telegram for inspiring me to continue coding. I also thank Bianca Caroline Orsso for providing me with a welcoming environment for software development. I dedicate this library to our daughter Alice, who will be born in August 2025.

At no time did I receive any funding for this project. I developed it in a few late nights between October and November 2024 and have now resumed work in July 2025 to make it public before it disappears from my files. I haven't documented many things, and I don't really remember how certain things work, so unfortunately, I don't plan on giving the project much attention in the future. I hope community members will continue and improve certain things I couldn't achieve in time for releaseâ€”like adding additional features or improving the software's performance.

To be clear, I used the following as a basis for this library:

It wasn't effective by far, but some times, AI chatbots were assisted with chatgpt3 (https://chatgpt.com/) and Meta AI (https://www.meta.ai/). At great cost, these chatbots helped me fix certain bugs in the code, as well as help me find alternatives for some of the functions, so they should be mentioned here.
